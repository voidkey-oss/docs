## What is Voidkey?

Voidkey is a **zero-trust credential broker** that eliminates the need for long-lived secrets in modern workflows. It dynamically mints short-lived, scoped credentials using OIDC-based authentication, creating a secure bridge between identity providers and cloud resources.

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Zero Trust Architecture" icon="shield">
		No shared secrets between clients and cloud providers. Each component authenticates independently.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Dynamic Credentials" icon="refresh">
		Generate temporary credentials on-demand with configurable expiration times.
	</Card>
	<Card title="OIDC Integration" icon="key">
		Native support for GitHub Actions, Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, and more identity providers.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Multi-Cloud Support" icon="cloud">
		Works with AWS and MinIO, with Azure and GCP support coming soon.

## Key Features

- **üîê True Zero-Trust**: Separate authentication for clients and broker with no shared secrets
- **üîë Key-Based Access**: Fine-grained permission control with named credential keys
- **üöÄ Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade NestJS server with comprehensive security features
- **üõ†Ô∏è Developer Friendly**: Easy-to-use CLI and well-documented REST API
- **üì¶ Extensible**: Plugin architecture for custom identity and cloud providers
- **üß™ Well Tested**: Comprehensive test suite with full coverage

## Use Cases

### CI/CD Pipelines
Eliminate hardcoded secrets in your CI/CD pipelines. Voidkey integrates natively with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and other platforms to provide secure, temporary credentials for deployments.

### Development Workflows
Provide developers with time-limited access to cloud resources without distributing long-lived credentials. Perfect for local development and testing scenarios.

### Microservices Authentication
Enable secure service-to-service communication with dynamic credential generation based on service identity.

### Compliance & Auditing
Meet security compliance requirements with comprehensive audit logging and credential lifecycle tracking.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Request temporary AWS credentials
voidkey mint --keys AWS_DEPLOYMENT

# Use in your workflow
export $(voidkey mint --keys AWS_DEPLOYMENT --output env)
aws s3 cp build/ s3://my-bucket/ --recursive
```

## Architecture Overview

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CLI as Client<br/>CLI
    participant ClientIdP as Client IdP<br/>(Auth0, GitHub, etc)
    participant Broker as Voidkey<br/>Broker
    participant BrokerIdP as Broker IdP<br/>(Keycloak, Okta, etc)
    participant Provider as Access<br/>Provider (STS)

    CLI->>ClientIdP: 1. Get client OIDC token
    ClientIdP->>CLI: Return client token
    
    CLI->>Broker: 2. Request credentials with token
    Note over Broker: 3. Validate client token
    
    Broker->>BrokerIdP: 4. Get broker OIDC token
    BrokerIdP->>Broker: Return broker token
    
    Broker->>Provider: 5. Mint credentials with broker token
    Provider->>Broker: 6. Return temp credentials
    
    Broker->>CLI: 7. Return temp credentials to client
    
    CLI->>Provider: 8. Use credentials for operations
```

1. **Client gets OIDC token** from their identity provider (GitHub Actions, Auth0, etc.)
2. **Client requests credentials** from Voidkey broker with OIDC token and key names
3. **Broker validates client token** against the client's identity provider JWKS
4. **Broker gets its own token** from the broker's identity provider for authentication
5. **Broker mints credentials** using its token to authenticate with cloud provider STS
6. **Cloud provider returns** temporary, scoped credentials to the broker
7. **Broker returns credentials** to the client with expiration information
8. **Client uses credentials** for authorized operations against cloud resources
